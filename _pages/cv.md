Personal Profile
======
I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in probability and statistics at SMS, Peking University. I also took lots of advanced classes such as homological algebra in pure math and I organized several seminars on topics, for example, K theory, elliptic curves with my classmates. The training in pure maths such as algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, harmonic analysis equipped me with solid foundation of algebra, geometry, and analysis, enabling me to treat applied problems in computation and optimization with more advanced tools. During the research in applied math such as Wasserstein dynamics, I enjoy using the perspective from pure math to view the problems and I focus on finding new mathematical structures in those problems. Meanwhile, I minored in computer science during my undergraduate study, hoping to enhance my ability in programming and using numerical tools to solve problems. Programming in Matlab, python helps me verify some theoretic problems as well as provides me with some intuition on various areas.
