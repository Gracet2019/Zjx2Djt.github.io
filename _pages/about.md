Personal Information
======

I'm an undergraduate in the School of Mathematical Science(SMS), Peking University(PKU). During my first two years in PKU, I had some interesting research experience on the [Homological Mirror Symmetry(HMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_mirror_symmetry) under the supervision of Prof. [Lei Yang](http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/jsdw/js_20180628175159671361/y_20180628175159671361/69985.htm). Now, my research advisors are Prof. [Hao Ge](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~gehao/English%20version/main_english.htm) and Dr. [Wuchen Li](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~wcli/). I'm lucky and pleasant to be advised by them.


Research Interest
======

I'm primarily interested in several areas related to optimal transport, including statistical optimal transport, mathematical physics equation(i.e. Schrodinger equation) and Ricci Flow. A detailed list below:
  * Wasserstein statistics and data science, Wasserstein barycenter and mathematical theory of GAN.
  * Stochastic analysis and stochastic mechanics, and probability dynamics.
  * Wasserstein geometry, dynamics and connections with equations in mathematical physics, Ricci Flow. [Here](/files/Ricci_survey.pdf) is some survey on interaction between Ricci Flow, entropy, and optimal transport.
  * Application to the numerical solution of PDE, design of discrete schemes for PDE from geometric property.
