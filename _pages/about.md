I'm an undergraduate in the School of Mathematical Science(SMS), Peking University(PKU). During my first two years in PKU, I had some research experience on the [Homological Mirror Symmetry(HMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_mirror_symmetry) under the supervision of Prof. [Lei Yang](http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/jsdw/js_20180628175159671361/y_20180628175159671361/69985.htm). Now, my research advisors are Prof. [Haoge](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~gehao/English%20version/main_english.htm) and Dr. [Wuchen Li](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~wcli/).

I'm primarily interested in several areas related to optimal transport, including statistical optimal transport, mathematical physics equation(i.e. Schrodinger equation) and Ricci Flow.
