I'm an undergraduate in the School of Mathematical Science(SMS), Peking University(PKU). During my first two years in PKU, I had some research experience on the [Homological Mirror Symmetry(HMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_mirror_symmetry) under the supervision of Prof. [Lei Yang](http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/jsdw/js_20180628175159671361/y_20180628175159671361/69985.htm). Now, my research advisors are Prof. [Haoge](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~gehao/English%20version/main_english.htm) and Dr. [Wuchen Li](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~wcli/).

I'm primarily interested in several areas related to optimal transport, including statistical optimal transport, mathematical physics equation(i.e. Schrodinger equation) and Ricci Flow. A detialed list below:
1. Wasserstein geometry, dynamics and connections with equations in mathematical physics.
2. Application to the numerical solution of PDE, design of discrete schemes for PDE from geometric property.
3. Wasserstein statistics and data science, Wasserstein barycenter and mathematical theory of GAN.
4. Stochastic analysis and stochastic mechanics.
