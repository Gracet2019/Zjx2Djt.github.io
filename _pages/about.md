I'm an undergraduate in the School of Mathematical Science(SMS), Peking University(PKU). I has a research experience on the [Homological Mirror Symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_mirror_symmetry), under the supervision of Prof. [Lei Yang](http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/jsdw/js_20180628175159671361/y_20180628175159671361/69985.htm). Now, my research advisor is Prof. [Haoge](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~gehao/English%20version/main_english.htm) and Dr. [Wuchen Li](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~wcli/).
